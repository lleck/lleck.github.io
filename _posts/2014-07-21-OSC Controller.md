# OSC Controller

This is a controller built for physical sound modeling. Each holds a gyroscope, an accelerometer, two pushbuttons and a joystick connected to an arduino. These devices were built to send OSC messages to supercollider. Several different programs were written in supercollider to be performed with these controllers. It extends the virtual coded synths with a sensible motion interface, which needs some training to be played decently, but then opens up to a new dimension of virtual sound-design.
