# Akai S20 bend

This is one product of my leisure time tinkering. I bent the circuits of this Akai s20 sampler, so there are 50 bendingpoints to shorten the ram of the sampler in a modular way, which results in weird manipulation of the sounds.

# Kawai K1 bend

Something similar I did with the KAWAI K1 FM-synth, which contains an integrated circuit providing the different
waveforms and percussive sounds. Just like on the Akai s20 I integrated a 'bendbus'on the faceplate, exposing all the
pins of that chip to the user, waiting to get shortened or connected to one of the attached momentary buttons.
