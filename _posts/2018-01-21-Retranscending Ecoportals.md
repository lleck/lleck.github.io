Retranscending Ecoportals (RE) are interfacing with an ecosystem in order to connect the inner spheres of a natural system with the outer world. Rather than applying a rational algorythmic process to emit abstract data to the 'outside' of the ecosystem, it much more transcends the natural processes through an amorphous-transcension-algorithm (ATA) and thereby enables singular intimate experiences.

The RE shown in this example aims at aquatic ecosystems. It transforms the events in the aquatic sphere into both sonic and visual events on the aqua-surface above. The natural strata is transcended into an organic virtuality that opens up a channel between the observer and pristine nature.
