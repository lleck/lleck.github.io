# (*in progress*) A Sonic Prayer to Vaiyuh

***Another transcendental interface in development:***

The tools/ interfaces in development, are aiming at the medium air,
specifically air in movement/ wind. The attempt is to build a kind of kit to setup a *temple for the wind*.


Wind is:
![winddata](/pictures/winddata.jpg)
not only data but:
*air mass in movement*, *breath of the earth*, *voice of the gods*, *transporter of life*, *seeder*, *motor of discovery*, *chaosmachine*, *hazard*,   **creator & destroyer**


## The toolkit: Organnodes

![toolkit](/pictures/Toolkit.jpg)

Organnodes are aesthetic machines, to open up a *'transcendent'* communications channel.
Instead of redacting the collected data in order to extract meaning - as interfaces usually do (visually) these days - they transform the data into an aesthetic (sonic) experience that enhances perception.

Wind data is collected and then further *transcended* by motorized organ-flutes. Whereas the transmission takes place digitally the conversion decides to forgo other mediums then air itself.

The alterity of aesthetic machines -among others- is their use of a different kind of algorithms. These are neither built towards performance nor to simplify complexities. While those algorithms are still based on binary structures they strive towards multiplicities. Instead of calculating results they digest data, transforming it in an organic manner. The outcome is potential aesthetic value, errors are impossible.
